# Framework

I used node.js and Javascript for this app. I also used the following nope packages inquirer, axios, html-pdf, util, and fs.

# Code

The app utilizes try/await/catch in an async function to obtain user input and run an axios call to github.

utilizing template literals html code is generated and returned data is organized and displayed

css is added inline and include a background color specified by the user from the initial prompt.

# API

Github is the only api used and does not require a key

# Improvements

The html-pdf npm has limited usability and apparently security issues. This could be replaced to provide wider/simpler styling options.

# What I learned

learning to use the try await catch methods was quite difficult and required quite a bit of outside help on this project but I was able to offer help to others in the area of styling.
