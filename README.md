# pdf-generator

This is a pdf generator that will create a formated pdf with the infomration available on git hub for a provided username. It is also able to add simple styling based on user input.

you will need to have the following npm's installed - inquirer, axios, html-pdf.

learning to use the try await catch methods was quite difficult and required quite a bit of outside help on this project but I was able to offer help to others in the area of styling.
